# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to practice visualizing data through interactive maps. Leaflet.js API was used to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. The magnitude and location of the earthquake will be shown when the popup marker is clicked.
